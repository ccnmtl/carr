# CARR/CARE

The Child Abuse Recognition & Reporting Project (CARR - now called CARE) is an on-line resource to provide a guided structure to Child Abuse Reporting Requirements courses at the SSW and CDM. The course material includes text, interactive case studies, follow-up evaluation (sectional quizzes or a comprehensive final test), and a take-away review of the course.
