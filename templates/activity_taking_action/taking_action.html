You are working with a father and his 10-year daughter at a family agency. The father and the girl’s mother are divorcing, and they are fighting for custody of their daughter. The daughter tells you that her mother’s new boyfriend is "creepy." You ask the little girl what she means, and she tells you that the boyfriend tells her that he likes sex. The father interrupts, “That man is a pervert and he should not be anywhere near my daughter. He is scaring my daughter. She told me that he rubbed up against her. Isn’t that right honey?" The girl nods her head yes. "That jerk should not be in that house. Her mother is not protecting her." You wonder if the father is making up this story to win custody of his daughter.

 A mother brings her 3 year old son to your clinic for a check-up. During the exam, you notice a laceration on the child's lip, and fractured lower incisors. Upon questioning the mother, she tells you that the child hurt himself accidentally when he ran into a doorknob four days ago.

    You notice that the child is too short to have sustained the injury on a doorknob. Furthermore, running into a doorknob is not likely to cause a lip laceration, and most mouth injuries impact the upper, not the lower teeth. The child is too young to tell you what happened, and the mother's story is not reasonable.

    Although the child does not appear to be in imminent danger, you cannot rule out that he has not been abused. You call the SCR to file a report and within the next 2 days, you complete and submit the LDSS-2221A. If the SCR determines that the child may be in an abusive home, the local authorities will be contacted. Your job as a mandated reporter is complete.
