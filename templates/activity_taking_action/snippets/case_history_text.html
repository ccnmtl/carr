You are working with a father and his 10-year daughter at a family agency. The father and the girl's mother are divorcing, and they are fighting for custody of their daughter. The daughter tells you that her mother's new boyfriend is "creepy." You ask the little girl what she means, and she tells you that the boyfriend tells her that he likes sex. The father interrupts, "That man is a pervert and he should not be anywhere near my daughter. He is scaring my daughter. She told me that he rubbed up against her. Isn't that right honey?" The girl nods her head yes. "That jerk should not be in that house. Her mother is not protecting her." You wonder if the father is making up this story to win custody of his daughter.
